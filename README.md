<h1>CashMaps</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

This is a website I created as a personal project to learn web development. I lived and traveled on a sailboat with my family for 3 years, and we saved our movement on our GPS chart plotter. On this website, users upload a text file containing lat-long data, and it is displayed on a map.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

The website is by no means finished or production-ready. There are still bugs to work out and incomplete features (there are extra tabs at the top, not mentioned in the description above). Disclaimer aside, it can be viewed at CassiusClose.com.
